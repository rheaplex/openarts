An art-specific license will be better suited to artworks. <h3>Doesn't &quot;Fair use&quot; cover this?</h3><p>No. The OAL gives much broader permission to copy, distribute and use works.</p><h3>Can I de-license a work?</h3><p>No. Once you've let the genie out of the bottle you can't put it back in. Open Artworks remain open once they are placed under the OAL.</p>  <h3><a href="../start.html">Back to the index.</a></h3>  <h4>Copyright &copy; 2001 Open Art Foundation.</h4>  </blockquote>  </body>  </html>
